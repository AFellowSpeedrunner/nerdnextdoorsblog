title: "Contributing to Alpine aports"
---

Something most people don't think of... unless you use postmarketOS on your phone and you wanted to port something over to main Alpine.

Now, I think my blog would be the perfect space to share this. [I did share this on Mastodon at one point](https://mastodon.social/@mrmasterkeyboard/113827494336235922), but this would go more indepth as to why.

What did I port (if you didn't bother to click the hyperlink I had, how rude! /j) you may ask? I ported a long time favourite package of an OS I liked. None other than the [Kuroko programming language](https://github.com/kuroko-lang/kuroko) for [ToaruOS](https://github.com/klange/toaruos)!

Honestly, this is so niche that I really don't think anyone has ever ran Kuroko on postmarketOS let alone the Pixel 3a.

After compiling all of it together on my phone and joking that I would submit it to the repos on my Mastodon post, one person in my comments section actually convinced me to do it. So, [I submitted it](https://gitlab.alpinelinux.org/alpine/aports/-/merge_requests/78565).

Ask and you shall recieve, my fedi friend. Besides, it'd be a fun first contribution to Alpine repos. It was frustrating trying to get a working, non-lint warning, fully working APKBUILD but in the end I got it in less than 24 hours.

I think it was quite impressive about how fast I got this all working. It took a bit of time, but it was fully worth it.

As of writing, the merge request on their GitLab is still to go through but I believe it will go somewhere soon enough.

This page may change over time, keep a look out please!

(And my mistake, this post was originally contributed under my Alpine GitLab forwarding email. I guess this just shows how much I've worked on this that I've forgotten to change email!)
